## What is this?

This is an online tool for Arknights players to calculate resource income and future available pulls.

## How do I use it?

* Enter your current resources at the top (orundum, HH permits, OP, monthly card).

* If you have cleared a past event, check "already cleared" on the banner for the rerun (the OP from the rerun will be disregarded).

* Scroll down to the banner you want to pull on, and check the blue column: these are the pulls you will have available if you convert all of your OP (the rate is 0.3 pulls/OP). The next two columns list the pulls without converting OP and the additional pulls you get from the converted OP.

## NOT included in the calculations

* **24 free pulls** on each limited banner (every 3 months) are listed separately. They are excluded from the running total because they can't be saved.
* **Distinction Certificates** (gold certs), mostly from recruitment and extra event welfare tokens, you can exchange 258 of them for 38 HH permits.
* Any orundum from the **Intelligence Certification Store** (purple certs) beyond the 2000 orundum added on each rerun. Note that this orundum does not expire after the rerun ends. Therefore, if you are a new player or you have not cleared past reruns, you can still purchase any remaining orundum.
* Maintenance compensation and random gifts in the mail.

## Assumptions

* Weekly annihilation reward (1800 orundum) received on Monday.
* 4 HH permits bought from the store (green certs) on the 1st day of the month.
* During limited events, fortune strips award 580 orundum daily on average.
* Weekly missions completed on Thursday (500 orundum).
