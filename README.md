## What is this?

This is an online tool for Arknights players to calculate resource income and future available pulls.

## How do I use it?

* Enter your current resources at the top (orundum, HH permits, OP, monthly card).

* If you have cleared a past event, check "already cleared" on the banner for the rerun (the OP from the rerun will be disregarded).

* Scroll down to the banner you want to pull on, and check the last two columns: these are the pulls you will have available with and without converting your OP (the rate is 0.3 pulls/OP).

## NOT included in the calculations

* **24 free pulls** on each limited banner (every 3 months), since they can't be saved
* **Distinction Certificates** (gold certs), mostly from recruitment and extra event welfare tokens, you can exchange 258 of them for 38 HH permits
* Orundum from the **Intelligence Certification Store** (purple certs), you get it from reruns if you already bought furniture pieces
* Maintenance compensation and random gifts in the mail

## Assumptions

* weekly annihilation reward (1800 orundum) received on Monday
* 4 HH permits bought from the store (green certs) on the 1st day of the month
* weekly missions completed on Thursday (500 orundum)
