## What is this?

This is an online tool for Arknights players to calculate resource income and future available pulls.

## How do I use it?

Enter your current resources at the top (orundum, HH permits, OP, monthly card).

If you have cleared a past event, check "already cleared" on the banner for the rerun (the OP from the rerun will be disregarded).

## NOT included in the calculations

* **24 free pulls** on each limited banner (every 3 months), since they can't be saved
* **Distinction Certificates** (gold certs), mostly from recruitment and extra event welfare tokens, you can exchange 258 of them for 38 HH permits
* Orundum from the **Intelligence Certification Store** (purple certs), you get it from reruns if you already bought the furniture
* Maintenance compensation and random gifts in the mail
