# Data directory

This directory contains three files generated during the build phase:

- daily_resources.json
- image-colors.json
- raw_google_sheet.json

These are ignored by git and generated by github actions.

This readme file exists so that the empty data folder exists during build by github actions, otherwise the build fails.
